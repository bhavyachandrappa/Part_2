# First Application: Transit

## Link to application: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thetransitapp.droid&hl=en

### •	Describe the application
    Transit application is a real-time application used by commuters who travel by MetroTransit and ferry. The user has an option to select their transit mode as MetroTransit or ferry or both in the application settings. The application asks for user’s location and displays all the transits and ferries that commute in user’s region. Fig 1 shows each transit and ferry are displayed in different colors in a list. As a color to a transit or ferry is unique and constant, the users can easily identify their transit or ferry in the displayed list. The time schedule of the transits and ferries for the whole day can be seen in the application. The list also shows the number of minutes left for the arrival of the transport(Fig 4). 
    Commuters can track transits or ferries arriving at their nearest transit/ferry stop by clicking on location symbol for the transport and the screen displays the transport route and location on the map. The application also provides reminder option for each arrival time. When the reminder option is selected for a time, the option reminds the user to leave the current location in a few minutes to catch the transit or ferry.

### •	Explain why this application was chosen
    I use the application daily as I choose to travel by transit in Halifax. There are times that I have missed my transit. With the help of the application, I have taken next available transit or alternate transit to my desired location as displayed in Fig 1. 

### •    Explain what the buy-in for the user is (why would someone use it?), 
    Transit is go-to application for someone who travels by transit or ferry. The application assists users in catching their transport on time! Fig 1 shows of how the application also displays the transit stop number to help users in identifying the transit stop.

### •	Identify what combination of technologies is leveraged
    Fig 2. shows that Transit application uses OpenStreetMap services which uses Xapi and Overpass API to track and record user’s experiences.

### •	Identify the type of the application
    Transit application is a Locale based application and is run on Android, Javascript, C++, and CSS are used to develop the application.

### •	Describe the application's strengths and weaknesses
  _Strengths:_
   * We can easily track our transit on Transit Maps in Transit application. Since the application is a real-time application, the transit time changes on application based on real-time arrival. Helps when we are running few minutes late and transit is few minutes late as well! 
   
  _Weakness:_
   * When the location is entered in the search bar of the application as shown in Fig 3, the transits to the location will be displayed in the screen and the location cannot be erased from the search bar. Due to this, the user must close and open the application from the start. 

### •	Suggest any improvement that you would make
    An option to refresh the page or to erase the entered location in the search bar of the application.

## First Heuristic Evaluation: Match between system and real world
    Transit application tracks the transits and ferries. The user can know the location and arrival time of the transit or ferry. When a transit is earlier or late than arrival time, the application reflects the real time of the transit. The application uses simple details of the transit to let a user know about the transit number, the destination of the transit, time in which transit is going to arrive. The transits are displayed in unique colors since the color is constant the user can easily identify the transit when they use the application next time.
    Location symbol to track the transit at each stop, remind option to remind the user about the arrival of transit (Fig 5), “GO” option to notify the user in taking the transit by providing walking distance and time to walk to the transit stop are provided in the application. Overall, the application helps the user to take the transit in the simplest way.

## Second Heuristic Evaluation: Help and documentation
    As shown in Fig 6. Help option is provided in the Settings section of the application. Right from how to use the application to how to customize the application, all the details are provided in Help. The help information is easy to understand by the user. Necessary screenshots and videos are provided for each help information. 
    Therefore, The help information explains how the application works and assist users in how to change the application settings. When the user follows the assistance provided by the application, the user has never had a hard time in understanding or following the information provided.
    
# Second Application: Splitwise

## Link to application: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Splitwise.SplitwiseMobile&hl=en

### •	Describe the application
    Dividing bills/receipts such as electricity bill, groceries receipts, tenant insurance etc., among flatmates will be a bit of hassle as the bills cannot be tracked always and there will be an inconvenience when anyone is low on money to settle the bill. Tracking bills and diving the money equally/unequally can be done with the help of a mobile application called Splitwise. 
	The user can create a group on Splitwise and add their flatmates to the group. The money that needs to split in the group will be entered as an activity. The application asks for an equal or unequal split. If a group member has a larger share in the amount, unequal split helps to enter a larger share to the person. The amount can also be split by percentages, shares, and adjustment. When the amount entered in Spiltwise is transferred to the person who’s owing the amount, the application notifies that the amount is settled. 
    Additionally, the application also helps users to simplify the debts. Debts are tracked and if a user owes a certain amount of money and his flatmates owe him some money, then the money from each will be subtracted and simplified to a smaller amount as shown in Fig 1.

### •	Explain why this application was chosen
    I use the application frequently to add an activity in the application (Fig 2) or to check the activity that is added by my flatmates. When I forget how much I owe, I use the application to check the amount. 

### •    Explain what the buy-in for the user is (why would someone use it?), 
    A user can use the Splitwise application to check for which activity they are owing money. If a certain grocery item is not used by the user and if the item money is shared between the user and flatmates, the user can ask the activity creator to be not considered for sharing. This is an added advantage since many of us overview the bill items and just mainly check for the bill amount.

### •	Identify what combination of technologies are leveraged
    Languages, Ruby and Javascript are used in developing Splitwise. The application uses Ruby on Rails that is flexible framework and that promotes best standards for web development to express logic of the application

### •	Identify the type of the application
	Splitwise is a productivity application that helps us in doing small tasks in a simple and efficient way.

### •	Describe the application's strengths and weaknesses
 _Strengths:_
* 	Split the amount between flatmates
*	Notifying when the amount is settled
*	Provides whiteboard to save important detail that is visible to group members(Fig 6).

 _Weakness:_
*	When a user adds a comment in an activity, the activity duplicates to a new activity confusing the user about two activity with the same content but with added comments in one of them.
*	A user can add an image to activity such as receipt image or a bill image, once added the user cannot view the image unless it is uploaded. 

### •	Suggest any improvement that you would make
    Option to crop the added image in the activity and to view the image before uploading the image can be provided

## Screenshots:

## First Heuristic Evaluation: Flexibility and efficiency of use
    The application is flexible to use and easy to understand for an inexperienced user. The application provides a + button to add an activity that navigates to a new activity page to create one. The application displays three Tabs (fig 1, 3 and 4). They are, Friends Tab, Groups Tab and Activity Tab.  The + button is present at the bottom right corner in the application page(Fig 1, 3 and 4). The number of groups that are created in the group and the amount owed from each group is displayed under Groups Tab. Activity tab that is present right next to Groups helps the user to check for activities and notifications. Friends Tab helps the user to view total balance and amount owed from or owe to each flatmate in the groups. 
    The + button is an advantage for the user to add multiple activities instead of navigating to a different page to create a new activity. Each item on the grocery list will be added on Splitwise using + button. This helps users when many different grocery items are bought at once and are put up in Splitwise to share the money.
	Furthermore, all the details on the Splitwise can be exported as spreadsheet and can be saved on the drive. The spreadsheet can be later accessed on a computer or any other device from the drive

## Second Heuristic Evaluation: Help and documentation
